#Tasks
A five-pages Project idea document. In this small document, you will put in a written
form your pitch presentation. In details, you are required to formalise the project topic and
to motivate, in a written form:

– the relevance to the course; - Wim

– the innovative and challenging nature of the project; - Ruben

– the requirements/specifications of the application to develop (e.g. using MOSCOW
requirement prioritisation); - Rick

– a coarse-grained execution plan, with responsibilities clearly assigned to each group
member ;

– a coarse-grained business plan;

– Flow diagram of major system components, and mockups of any user-facing interfaces
(crowdworkers and end-users)

– your planned evaluation and success metrics.

The project idea documents must be delivered by Week 4.

NOTE 1: the requirement specifications must be complete. The design and implementation
may address only a subset of the specifications, for time/effort reasons. Identify some system
functions (5/6) – a core set – keeping in mind that functions should support user needs.

NOTE 2: while the complete specification should be ready by Week 4, you are strongly
invited to start development as soon as possible
The Project idea document will be assessed according to the Rubric reported in Table 2

#The relevance to the course

The relevance of our project to the course is as follows. As described in the introduction slide of the course, search is a fundamental human activity. The system which will be implemented helps humans search for places, in Amsterdam, where certain sport activities will be carried out. The introduction slide also states that since the beginning of the written work, people tried to organize information, but there is a problem, namely, information overload. The product "Amsterdam in motion" organizes the overload of social media data and categorizes this into different sport categories. So the project is very relevant to the course, since the final product will organize an overload of social media data which helps humans search for places and times where certain sport activities will be carried out.
